    <p>
      Jimmy Thrasher is a deep thinker who writes deep songs that remain
      accessible. His music is honest and authentic, with thoughtful lyrics
      supported by guitar work that is complex and musical. With his deep love
      for learning, Jimmy&rsquo;s songs draw from wildly different (and sometimes
      obscure) topics&mdash;but always with the common thread of everyone&rsquo;s shared
      humanity and value.
